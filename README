gr-dect2
========

This project was developed to demonstrate the possibility of real-time DECT voice
channel decoding  by Gnuradio  It allows to listen to voice when encryption isn't used. 
As an example DECT digital baby monitors don't perform encryption. Usage of this project 
for phone connection eavesdropping may be illegal in some countries.



Hardware requirements
---------------------
This project was tested with USRP2 + WBX daughterboard.
As a DECT link source the Motorola MBP12 baby monitor was used.



To build
--------
git clone git://github.com/pavelyazev/gr-dect2.git
cd gr-dect2/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

Then Gnuradio companion should be used to open flow graph dect2.grc from gr-dect/grc
